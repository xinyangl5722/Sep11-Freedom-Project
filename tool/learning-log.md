# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Kaboom**

## Project: **Pixel Game (still planning)**

---

### 10/13/2024:
* I decided to dig deep into Kaboom since I didn't do that well of a research
	* I looked into the official website first
	* I first went into the playground and looked at some examples. I went into some sort of code where a sprite can move
	* I looked through examples. (I couldn't really find a way to tinker on jsbin because I need an image and I don't have one.)

### 10/18/2024:
* I first created a whole directory dedicate to tinkering my tool
* I decidded to learn how to get kaboom into my IDE
	* I went to the tutorial section of the official website
	* I first learned how to get the CDN into my IDE
	* I copied the CDN into my html
	* Now it's a grey and white checkered background

### 10/19/2024:
* I learned how to put a sprite inside my testing code.
	* I first grabbed a random transparent png photo and then put it in the directory
	* Then I added my sprite into my code
 ```js
const player = add([
	sprite("ghost"),   // sprite() component makes it render as a sprite
 	pos(120, 80),     // pos() component gives it position, also enables movement
])
```
* But when I looked at my sprite, it was too big
