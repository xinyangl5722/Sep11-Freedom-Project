## Project: **Pixel Game (still planning)**

### 10/30/2024:
* I decided to dig deep into Kaboom since I didn't do that well of a research
  * I looked into the official website first
  * I first went into the playground and looked at some examples. I went into some sort of code where a sprite can move
  * I looked through examples. (I couldn't really find a way to tinker on jsbin because I need an image and I don't have one.)
