## Deciding my tool
I had recently decided on what the topic of my freedom project is going to be. To sum it up, it is an interactive pixel story game. This is only the base of my idea so I may need to think about it a bit more. While I had put that aside, I had picked out my tool for my project. The tool is called **Kaboom**. I decided to tinker with this tool because of how my aspects of this game fits in this tool.
I first researched Kaboom on the [official website](https://kaboomjs.com/). I first went to the [playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) to see how each code works for different components. Then I started to look at the code to see how it works. I basically installed kaboom into my learning log and I used the code in the playground inside my testing section. So basically one of the first components I did was making a sprite move. So I basically did this.
```js
onKeyDown("left", () => {
	player.move(-SPEED, 0)
})
onKeyDown("right", () => {
	player.move(SPEED, 0)
})
onKeyDown("up", () => {
	player.move(0, -SPEED)
})
onKeyDown("down", () => {
	player.move(0, SPEED)
})
```

## EDP
I have already defined my problem, and brainstormed a possible solution, so now I am **planning the solution**. I am currently planning my game and planning on what to use with my tool. I am still currently in the stage of planning my solution as I still need to figure out the sequence of my game and the components I need for kaboom to make my game.
